Welcome to your first day. My name is John, I'm your boss and I'll be showing you how to do your job. As you already know, your job is to find bad people and report them so we can take appropriate action.#So, let's keep this quick and to the point.
On the left side of the screen you can see a section of our city where you can observe people.#You can click most things on this part of the screen and see what they are on the right side of your screen.
Here, you'll see all the information you can about anything you click on. The first box shows the objectives of our suspect which will update when those objectives are completed.#The next box shows information of poeple or objects you click on.#And the last box shows conversations of people you click on.
For today, I want you to find and report a guy named Garry. Nothing to hard, I just want to see how you can do.#Click around on any person or thing you'd like, and try to find Garry, but try not to take too long.

Good job, you got him! I think you're all set then, I'll see you tomorrow!
